Today's world is one that moves at a breakneck speed--nowhere is this more clear than in our financial sector. Deals are closed and
stocks soar and fall capriciously, and often it becomes a struggle to keep one's head above the evermoving financial current. But it doesn't have 
to be this way. 

Enter CryptoTweet. With just some simple inputs, CryptoTweet keeps a vigilant eye on the twitters of cyptocurrency industry leaders 
and keeps you head and shoulders ahead of the competition in the world of cryptocurrency. 

But how does it work? 

Essentially, by inputting such things as (???, the name of the influencer, the amount of money you want to invest, etc...), CryptoTweet immediately 
invests in a specifc cryptocurrency that is mentioned positively by the influencer.

We do this with a combination of Microsoft Azure technology and Twitter's native API. By detecting these "triggering tweets", where cryptocurrency
is mentioned with an average postive sentiment score greater than or equal to the user's discretion, CryptoTweet invests your money in the cryptocurrency
instantaneously, providing the end user with profit when the value of the investment increases.
